Immortal Snake in JavaScript Canvas

##Instructions
Arrow keys to control the snake and eat food to grow longer. Don't worry about hitting yourself, you are immortal and cannot die! (This was a test project to familiarise myself with JavaScript after taking a break. I got bored and didn't add the player death functionality lol)

## Installation
1. Download repository and locate **index.html** in the **snake** folder.
2. Open **index.html** in any modern browser.
3. If you see 'Your browser does not support a canvas', use another browser.
